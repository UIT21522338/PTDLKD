<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Using Forecasting Models in Cryptocurrency Price Prediction

Predicting cryptocurrency price has become a central focus for investors and traders in the rapidly evolving landscape of digital assets. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other altcoins have captured global attention, with their prices subject to fluctuations influenced by various factors, from market sentiment to technological developments. With the unprecedented volatility of these markets, the need for
accurate forecasting models has never been more crucial. 
In this research, we conduct an in-depth analysis using various models including Linear regression (LR), Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA),
Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Seasonal
Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous factors (SARIMAX), Neural Basis Expansion
Analysis Time Series (NBEATS), Random Forest (RF) to predict prices of Bitcoin, Ethereum and BNB.

<!-- CONTRIBUTING -->
## My Contribution

I contributed to the following parts of the project:

1. LSTM Algorithm
   * Using the LSTM architecture with LSTM layers, and Dense layers in keras
   * Preprocessed data: normalized the data, created training and testing datasets from time-series data.
   * Evaluated the model using metrics like MAE (Mean Absolute Error) and RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) and MAPE(Mean absolute percentage error)
2. Linear Regression
   * Implemented the linear regression model using Scikit-learn.
   * Analyzed the linear relationships between independent variables and cryptocurrency prices.
   * Evaluated the model using metrics like MAE (Mean Absolute Error) and RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) and MAPE(Mean absolute percentage error)
3. NBeats Model
   * Applied the NBeats model to forecast nonlinear time-series data.
   * Designed a training pipeline with parameters like block layers and forecast horizon.
   * Evaluated and compared NBeats results against other models.
